# Hi there, I'm Santino 👋

AI/ML Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems and production-ready AI applications. Computer Science student at Universidad Nacional del Comahue with fullstack foundations and specialized expertise in RAG systems and conversational AI.

## What I Do

I specialize in **Conversational AI, RAG Systems, and LLM Applications**. My background in fullstack development gives me a solid understanding of system architecture, which I apply to build scalable ML solutions and robust backend services.

## Tech Stack

**AI/ML** — LangChain | RAG Systems | MongoDB Vector Search | LangFuse | Azure Phoenyx (observability)

**Backend** — FastAPI | Express.js | PostgreSQL | MongoDB

**Frontend** — Vue.js | Flutter | React

**DevOps & Tools** — Docker | Linux | Git | Shell Scripting

## Currently Working On

- Production-grade RAG systems with semantic search and LLM integrations
- Building observability and monitoring for ML applications
- Exploring emerging technologies in the AI/ML ecosystem
